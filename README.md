- Event listener
- Callback function

[Live Preview](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/kelvouttt/etch-a-sketch/blob/main/index.html)

There is few improvements needed (ofc it is i'm a noob). 
I want to list all the features need to be added:
- Prompt user to resize the box
- Adding interactive motion in button/pages
